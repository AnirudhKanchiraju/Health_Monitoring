 Health monitoring involves the regular assessment of an individual's well-being through various methods and technologies. Wearable devices such as fitness trackers and smartwatches track parameters like heart rate and sleep patterns. Mobile apps assist in monitoring diet, exercise, and mental health, offering insights and reminders. Telehealth and remote monitoring enable healthcare professionals to track patients' vital signs from a distance. Smart health devices, including scales and blood pressure monitors, provide real-time health data. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) store and organize health information for informed decision-making.  Biometric sensors measure physiological parameters like temperature and blood pressure. AI and data analytics analyze large datasets for accurate predictions and personalized health recommendations. Genomic health monitoring allows individuals to explore their genetic predispositions. Health screening programs identify potential issues through periodic checkups. Overall, health monitoring empowers individuals to take control of their well-being, facilitating preventive measures and early interventions for a proactive approach to healthcare. Effective communication between patients and healthcare providers is enhanced, leading to personalized and informed healthcare strategies.
